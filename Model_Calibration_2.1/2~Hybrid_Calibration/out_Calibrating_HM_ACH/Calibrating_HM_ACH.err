   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 3 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** Since Zone Minimum Air Flow Input Method = CONSTANT, input for Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate will be ignored.
   **   ~~~   ** Occurs in AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat = OFFICE TERMINAL 4
   ** Warning ** Since Zone Minimum Air Flow Input Method = CONSTANT, input for Fixed Minimum Air Flow Rate will be ignored.
   **   ~~~   ** Occurs in AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat = OFFICE TERMINAL 5

   ************* Beginning Simulation
   ** Warning ** Processing Monthly Tabular Reports: Variable names not valid for this simulation
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual variables.
   ** Warning ** GetCurrentScheduleValue: Schedule="ZN 1_BACK_ACH" is a Schedule:File
   **   ~~~   ** ...Use of Schedule:File when DaylightSavingTime is in effect is not recommended.
   **   ~~~   ** ...1) Remove RunperiodControl:DaylightSavingTime object or remove DST period from Weather File.
   **   ~~~   ** ...2) Configure other schedules and Schedule:File to account for occupant behavior during DST.
   **   ~~~   ** ...   If you have already done this, you can ignore this message.
   **   ~~~   ** ...When active, DaylightSavingTime will shift all scheduled items by one hour, retaining the same day type as the original.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-ELECTRICITY" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-DISTILLATE OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-RESIDUAL OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-COAL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ************* Simulation Error Summary *************
   ************* There are 6 unused schedules in input.
   ************* There are 6 unused week schedules in input.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
